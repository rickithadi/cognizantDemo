# Weather forecast webapp built with React, data.gov.sg APIs and Bootstrap

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
API can be found at [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg).

## Assumptions, Interpretation
- User only needs general weather conditions like 'windy' as opposed to specifics such as humidity etc which are only available in the 24hr weather API
- Lat and Long displayed are rounded off to 3SF
- Using data of closest weather station to camera, might not be completely exact.
